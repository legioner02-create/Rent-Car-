      "Learning how to drive is a lot easier than it looks. It looks intimidating from the passenger's seat, or in films, but once you get behind the wheel and gently put your foot on the pedal, the process becomes very intuitive. Learn to take things slow in the beginning and you'll be well on your way to mastering the basics. This article assumes you'll be driving a vehicle with an automatic transmission. If you're not driving an automatic, you'll need to read about the basics of driving stick-shift (manual transmission) instead, although the general process will still be similar.",

      " Although forecasts for the rate of EV adoption over the next decade vary widely given rapid changes in both government policies and the auto manufacturing industry in recent years—many forecasts expect a strong acceleration in EV adoption. S&P Global Mobility forecasts electric vehicle sales in the United States could reach 40 percent of total passenger car sales by 2030, and more optimistic projections foresee electric vehicle sales surpassing 50 percent by 2030.2 This Beyond the Numbers article examines the main factors expected to contribute to growth in the electric vehicle market and identifies some occupations that are expected to play a role in the design and development of electric vehicles, in the manufacturing of the batteries that power them, and in the installation and maintenance of the infrastructure needed to charge them.",

      " Transmission fluid: Many new vehicles come with sealed transmissions that don’t allow for easy checking or topping off of the fluid, but it’s still important to understand the role transmission fluid, or oil, plays in its operation. Depending on the vehicle, the transmission may have a service interval of up to 100,000 miles and require special equipment to replace it. A good rule of thumb for vehicles equipped with a traditional dipstick should be to check the fluid regularly and replace it according to the specifications outlined in your owners manual. Old fluid can accumulate dirt and debris and dramatically reduce your transmission’s performance and lifespan and burnt fluid can indicate severe wear of the internal components. Automatic transmissions can be finicky, so if you have any doubts, see your dealer or a qualified independent mechanic Power steering fluid: While electric and electrically-assisted power steering systems become more common every day, plenty of vehicles still utilize hydraulic power steering systems. These power steering systems use a fluid that can become contaminated over time, hampering performance and possibly causing leaks or damage to the system components. The fluid reservoir is generally located in an easily accessible location under the hood, making it easy to check each time vehicle’s engine oil is changed.",
