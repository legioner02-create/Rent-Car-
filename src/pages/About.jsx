                Umar Car Hire was established in 1996 with the sole purpose of making the car rental service accessible to a wide variety of clients, as our prices reflect. We pride ourselves in the fact that our company was the first indigenous car rental company in the kingdom.

                In supporting the local economy, the majority of the vehicles on our fleet are bought locally. In addition, every vehicle is registered in Swaziland. Affordable Car Hire has spread its wings, establishing a new branch in Manzini to ensure that our customers in that area also have access to our service.
